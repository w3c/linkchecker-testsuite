<div id="test">
    <p> <span id="test-id">base-5</span>: 
        test for base URI with Content-Base HTTP Header. The document has a relative link. 
        HREF of the link should be calculated with the BASE URI from the doc considered.
    </p>
    <p id="expected" class="200 OK">EXPECTED: 
        200 OK. The BASE href has precedence over the other mechanisms.
        If the Content-Base is followed, the link checker would find a 404. This is incorrect.
        If the current URI of the document is taken as a base, 
        the link checker would find a 403. This is incorrect.
